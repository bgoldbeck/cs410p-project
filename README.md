## How to play

`Space` to shoot, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` to move.

Grab power bombs to clear the screen.

## Troubleshooting

If your executable crashes, your video card may not support the necessary shaders for SDL2. You might try editing `conf.toml` and changing the window mode line to read `fullscreen_type = "Desktop"`.
